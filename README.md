# Hello, I'm [Luke Wolf] ðŸ‘‹

## Data Engineer @ Lockheed Martin | Machine Learning and Operations Research Engineer @ USF

### About Me
I'm a Data Engineer with a career that focuses on the creation and mainntenance of pipelines, databases, machine learning algorithms, operations research models, and data visualization. Currently enhancing fleet management systems and production operations at Lockheed Martin as a Data Engineer (contracted), Data Engineer in Production Operations (full-time), and conducting cutting-edge research with machine learning and operations research at the University of South Florida. I'm passionate about applying my technical skills to solve complex problems and optimize systems. I enjoy developing automated tasks, implmenting ETL methods, pipelines, DBMS, and more!

### Projects
#### Sludge-Content-Automation: 
Since social media grabs attention from the majority of the world's population, I developed a system to automate content development, posting, analytics, and optimization to potentially gain streams of revenue
- Langauges: Python, SQL
- Includes DBMS (SSMS), Machine Learning, APIs (Google, VirusTotal, SSMS), GUI (tkinter)

#### Satellite-Launch-Cost-Minimization-Operations-Research:
(Work In Progress) This is used to determine optimal sites for launching low orbit satellites into space
- Langauges: Python
- Includes DMBS (Excel), OR, APIs (NWS)

#### Airline Database 
Extremely large ariline database to consider as many aspects/tables possible with airline management, this is normalized into 3NF and all tables have relations
- Languages: SQL

**NOTE**: Since I work at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics and USF Research, I am unable to display the majority of my work. Due to this, I do not have many projects in my public portfolio for legal reasons.

I'm always open to collaborating on projects and innovative ideas. Feel free to connect with me!
