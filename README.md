# Hello, I'm [Luke Wolf] ðŸ‘‹

## Data Engineer | Machine Learning and Operations Research Engineer

### About Me
I'm a Software/Data Engineer with a focus on data engineering, data science, machine learning, and operations research. Currently enhancing fleet management systems and production operations at Lockheed Martin as a Data Engineer (contracted), data scientist (full-time), and conducting cutting-edge research with machine learning and operations research at the University of South Florida. I'm passionate about applying my technical skills to solve complex problems and optimize systems. I enjoy developing automated tasks, implmenting ETL methods, pipelines, DBMS, and more!

### Projects
#### Sludge-Content-Automation: 
Since social media grabs attention from the majority of the world's population, I developed a system to automate content development, posting, analytics, and optimization to potentially gain streams of revenue
- Langauges: Python, SQL
- Includes DBMS (SSMS), Machine Learning, APIs (Google, VirusTotal, SSMS), GUI (tkinter)

#### Satellite-Launch-Cost-Minimization-Operations-Research:
(Work In Progress) This is used to determine optimal sites for launching low orbit satellites into space
- Langauges: Python
- Includes DMBS (Excel), OR, APIs (NWS)

#### Airline Database 
Extremely large ariline database to consider as many aspects/tables possible with airline management, this is normalized into 3NF and all tables have relations
- Languages: SQL

**NOTE**: Since I work at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics and USF Research, I am unable to display the majority of my work. Due to this, I do not have many projects in my public portfolio for legal reasons.
